# Robotics-1
Degrees of freedom, essential across fields like stats, engineering, and physics, represent the minimum independent parameters to describe a system's state or behavior. Crucial in hypothesis testing, mechanical design, thermodynamics, chemistry, and statistics, they underpin system characterization and modeling.

<b>Assigning of X,Y,Z

DH Frame Rules</b><br>
1.The Z axis must be the axis of rotation for a revolute/twisting, or the direction of translation for prismatic joint. 

2.The X axis must be prependicular both to its own Z axis, and Z axis of the frame before it.

3.Each X axis must intersect the Z axis of the frame before it.
Rules of complying Rule 3:
-Rotate the axis until it hits the other.
-Or translate the axis until it hits the other.

4.All Frame must follow the right hand rule.
