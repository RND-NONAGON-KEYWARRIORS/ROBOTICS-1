Degrees of freedom, essential across fields like stats, engineering, and physics, represent the minimum independent parameters to describe a system's state or behavior. Crucial in hypothesis testing, mechanical design, thermodynamics, chemistry, and statistics, they underpin system characterization and modeling.
